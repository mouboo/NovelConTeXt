\chapter{FÃ¶rsta}
A book is a flexible mirror of the mind and the body. Its overall size and proportions, the color
and texture of the paper, the sound it makes as the pages turn, and the smell of the paper, adhesive
and ink, all blend with the size and form and placement of the type to reveal a little about the world
in which it was made. If the book appears to be only a paper machine, produced at their own convenienve by other machines, only machines will want to read it.
